Tiny CLI tool to remove unwanted connections from your Chia Node based on the Geo IP Location (Country). 
The Tool is written in golang and acts more like a command line wrapper around `chia show...`
and the cli tool `geoiplookup`

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

- Linux, MacOS (never tried it on Windows)
- `git` installed
- `go 1.16` installed
- `chia` is installed
- `geoiplookup` is installed (see below for installation instructions)

### Installation 

Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/St3ffn/chia-bouncer.git
cd chia-bouncer
```

Build the binary

```shell
go build
```

The tool `geoiplookup` is required to perform the Geo IP Location lookup.
Ubuntu 18 and Ubuntu 20 users can simply install it via:

```shell
sudo apt-get install geoip-bin
```

The installed package contains a database which is pretty old. 
To update it, download the newest from [here](https://dl.miyuru.lk/geoip/dbip/country/dbip4.dat.gz)
and unpack to `/usr/share/GeoIP`

```shell
wget https://dl.miyuru.lk/geoip/dbip/country/dbip4.dat.gz
gunzip dbip4.dat.gz
sudo mv dbip4.dat /usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat
```

You can check the age of the Geo IP Location database by running
```shell
geoiplookup localhost -v
   GeoIP Country Edition: DBIPLite-Country-CSV_20210401 converted to legacy DB with sherpya/geolite2legacy by miyuru.lk
   ...
```
Now you are ready to go.

### Usage

If your chia executable is located in `$HOME/chia-blockchain/venv/bin/chia`, you can simply run:
```bash
# assumes chia executable is located in $HOME/chia-blockchain/venv/bin/chia
# removes all connections from mars
> chia-bouncer mars
```
To specify a custom path to your chia executable use `--chiaexec` or `-e`
```bash
# custom defined chia executable
# removes all connections from "elon on mars"
> chia-bouncer -e /home/steffen/chia-blockchain/venv/bin/chia elon on mars
```
Call with `--help` or `-h` to see the help page 
```bash
> chia-bouncer -h

NAME:
   chia-bouncer - remove unwanted connections from your Chia Node based on Geo IP Location.

USAGE:
   chia-bouncer [-e CHIA-EXECUTABLE] LOCATION
   chia-bouncer -e /chia-blockchain/venv/bin/chia mars

DESCRIPTION:
   Tool will lookup connections via 'chia show -c', get ip locations via geoiplookup and remove nodes from specified LOCATION via 'chia show -r'

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --chia-exec CHIA-EXECUTABLE, -e CHIA-EXECUTABLE  CHIA-EXECUTABLE. normally located inside the bin folder of your venv directory (default: $HOME/chia-blockchain/venv/bin/chia)

### Verification

If you are on Linux or MacOS and you want the see the locations for the current connections you can use the following:

```shell
# go chia directory
cd chia-blockchain
# enable venv
. ./activate
# calls chia to show all connections, filter for FULL_NODE, print the ip, 
# print the IP and call geoiplookup command with ip, replace string "GeoIP Country Edition" with ""
chia show -c | grep FULL_NODE | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo {} $(geoiplookup {})' | sed 's! GeoIP Country Edition!!'
```

### Integration

The script can easily be integrated with cron. Simply open the users crontab via `crontab -e` and add the following line.

```shell
# run chia-bouncer every 2 hours and remove all connections from mars
0 */2 * * * /PATH/TO/chia-bouncer mars
```
